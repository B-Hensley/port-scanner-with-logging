## 📌 Features  
✅ **Multi-threaded scanning** – Faster results by scanning multiple ports simultaneously!  
✅ **Logging system** – Keeps track of each scan in `log.txt`!  
✅ **Scan counter** – Counts how many times you've used the scanner (`scan_count.txt`)!  
✅ **IPv4 & TCP support** – Scans based on common networking standards!

## 🚀 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Enter the target IP address**  
2️⃣ **The script scans the ports in the list**  
3️⃣ **Open and closed ports are displayed**  
4️⃣ **Results are logged in `log.txt`**  
5️⃣ **Scan count is updated in `scan_count.txt`**
